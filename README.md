# Closed-loop-propotional-controller-robot
this is a short-project, the goal is to design a closed loop propotional (P) controller, which allows the robot to move to a user specified (x,y) position. the movement happens by using non-holonomic constraints, in which we can control only two DOF of the robot and have limited capablities.
